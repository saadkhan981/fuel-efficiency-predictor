This repository contains code and documentation for developing a linear regression model to predict vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG) based on characteristics like horsepower, weight, and model year.

The goal is to identify the optimal model to accurately forecast MPG and determine the most influential factors on fuel efficiency. This can provide insights to guide engineering decisions and car design for improved fuel economy.

The project involved:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis
Building a baseline linear regression model
Identifying and removing multicollinear features
Model optimization using sequential feature selection
Evaluating and selecting the best model based on performance metrics
The final model uses just 3 features - horsepower, weight, and model year - and achieves an R-squared of 0.799 on test data.

The repository contains the full code, model evaluation results, and documentation explaining the approach and findings in detail.

This linear regression modeling project provides a useful example of how to build, optimize, and validate a predictive analytics model on a real-world dataset. The techniques and code can serve as a template for similar data science projects.
